# Weather-Dashboard-
This project is a dynamic Weather Dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI to visualize real-time and forecast weather data. The data is sourced from weatherapi.com 
and directly loaded into Power Bi for further processing.

It provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of current conditions, a weekly forecast, air quality, and other key meteorological metrics for selected locations.


**Features:**

>Current Weather Conditions: Displays the present temperature, weather description (e.g., "Patchy rain nearby"), and general status for the main location (e.g., Dehradun).

>Key Metrics: Shows important data like Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, UV-Index, and Precipitation values.

>Air Quality Index (AQI): Visual representation of air quality, highlighting key pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2.

>7-Day Forecast: A clear line chart illustrating the predicted temperature trend over the upcoming days, including the Chance of Rain percentage breakdown.

>Sunrise & Sunset: Specific daily times for sunrise and sunset.

>Multiple Locations: Quick access to the current temperature for other saved cities (e.g., Dehradun, Kathua).
